        <h1>Common Unit Systems</h1>
        <div class="text-content">
            <div>A unit system, or system of measurement, is a system comprised of interrelated units of measurement. Various
                unit systems have existed throughout history, and their importance remains evident today, as seen by their
                widespread use within society.
        
                In the past, unit systems were defined locally, and often, highly arbitrarily. As such, the length of a unit
                could vary significantly from region to region. For example, since some units in the past were often based on
                parts of the body, the unit of the "foot" could have a different definition based on the size of the foot of the
                king or feudal lord of a given region. Since travel was more limited in the past, local definition and use of
                units could be seen as being more practical. However, with the advent of globalization, particularly the growth
                of commerce and science, the arguable need for a universal system of measurement became more apparent.
        
                Standardized units of measurement facilitate communication between different cultures and countries that may
                otherwise choose to use local systems, potentially leading to confusion and miscommunication. The International
                System of Units (SI), the most widely used system of measurement today, was developed in an effort to provide a
                standardized, more rational system that could be used worldwide. Despite efforts to implement SI globally, there
                are still a few unit systems in common use, including the United States customary units, and the imperial system
                of measurement (though most countries that have not officially adopted SI still use SI to a certain extent).
                Although striving for standardization is important, since it is difficult to entirely eliminate the local use of
                historical unit systems, it is equally important to accept that other systems of measurement exist and be able
                to use them, or at least relate and convert them to the preferred unit system.
        
                The three common unit systems that are in use today are the International System of Units, United States
                customary units, and the imperial system of units.</div>
        
            <h2>International System of Units</h2>
            <div>The international System of Units (SI) is the modern form of the metric system and is comprised of seven base
                units that use twenty metric prefixes to denote decimal multiples or submultiples of the base unit. SI is
                intended as a coherent, rational system of measurement. It is a system that was stringently conceived and is
                defined based on invariant constants of nature including the speed of light, the triple point of water, and a
                physical prototype. In order to maintain reliability and precision, SI requires the precise definition of
                constants in addition to precise of measurement standards. As such, it is an evolving system that changes when
                more stable constants are discovered, or other constants can be more precisely measured. SI is the most widely
                used system of measurement, and the evolution of the system is still ongoing today. The SI base units as well 
                as a table of metric prefixes (courtesy of <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" style="text-decoration:none; color: blue">
                Wikipedia.org</a>) are listed below:</div>
            
                <h3>SI base units:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>ampere (symbol: A) – unit of electric</li>
                    <li>kelvin (symbol: K) – unit of temperature</li> 
                    <li>second (symbol: s) – unit of time</li>    
                    <li>meter (symbol: m) – unit of length</li>    
                    <li>kilogram (symbol: kg) – unit of mass</li>    
                    <li>candela (symbol: cd) – unit of luminous intensity</li>    
                    <li>mole (symbol: mol) – unit reflecting amount of a substance</li>    
                </ul>

                <h3>SI-derived units:</h3>
                <p>In addition, SI also includes 22 units of measurement that are derived from the 7 SI base units. These units are either dimensionless or are expressed as a product of one or more of the SI base units. Some of the more common examples of these include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>radian (symbol: rad) – unit of angle</li>
                    <li>newton (symbol: N) – unit of force or weight</li>
                    <li>watt (symbol: W) – unit of power</li>
                    <li>volt (symbol: V) – unit of voltage, electrical potential difference, and electromotive force</li>
                    <li>degree Celsius (symbol: °C) – unit of temperature</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Non-SI units accepted for use with SI:</h3>
                <p>There are also numerous units that are accepted for use with SI that are not considered SI units or SI derived units. Some of the more common examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>minute, hour, day (symbol: min, h, d respectively) – units of time</li>
                    <li>degree – (symbol: °C) – unit of temperature</li>
                    <li>liter – (symbol: L) – unit of volume</li>
                    <li>bar – (symbol: bar) – unit of pressure</li>
                    <li>millimeter of mercury (symbol: mmHg) – unit of pressure</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>History of SI</h2>
            <div>The International System of Units (SI) is the most widely used unit system in the world. It is the modern
                version of the metric system which was developed over time while borrowing units or ideas from other systems, in
                large part by a committee of the French Academy of Sciences, beginning in 1791.
        
                The process of metrication, including the eventual definition and adoption of the International System of Units
                was a slow process. France officially introduced the metric system in 1799, and the system spread throughout
                Europe during the 19th century. By the 1970s, metrication in the form of SI was complete in almost all countries
                around the world. Notable exceptions to this include the United Kingdom, the United States, Liberia, and
                Myanmar. Excluding the United Kingdom, these countries are the only countries that have not officially adopted
                SI.Although there are other countries in which units other than SI are primarily used, the US and the UK are the
                largest contributors to two of the other unit systems commonly used today. As such, the other countries, many of
                which use unit systems influenced by either the UK or the US, will not be discussed here.</div>
        
            <h2>United States customary units</h2>
            <div>United States customary units (UCS) are a system of measurements used in the United States (US). UCS originated
                from English units (not to be confused with imperial units) which were used by the British Empire starting as
                early as 1495 and continued to be used in the UK up until replacement by the imperial system in 1824. While UCS
                is primarily used for commercial, social, and personal applications, the US uses the International System of
                Units (SI) in many other areas including science, medicine, industry, the government, and the military.</div>
        
            <h2>Imperial system</h2>
            <div>The imperial system of measurements, also known as British Imperial, was defined in 1824, replacing the
                previous English units known as the Winchester Standards, which were in effect from 1588 to 1825. Although the
                United Kingdom has technically adopted the International System of Units (SI), in practice, the UK is much like
                the United States in that it uses SI in many areas such as industry, healthcare, government, science, and
                others, but still commonly uses a system derived from English units (the imperial system) in everyday life. The
                imperial system is also still in use in Canada as well as some other countries previous under the control of the
                British Empire.</div>
